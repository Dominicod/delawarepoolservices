# delwarepoolservices home page

Designed for a customer located within Delaware. This project had a three-day deadline due to the clients haste to launch a product 
for the beginning of summer. I learned a great deal about project scope, communicating, and defining expectations.


## Project technology

This project is running the following languages and tools:

* Bootstrap
* PHP

## What I learned

For this project I learned alot about how to communicate with a client and set realistic expectations. This was an amazing
amount of exposure in showing me how to conduct myself and prepare for scope creep.
